# Build + launch the wezig iOS shell on an iOS 17 Simulator from the REAL
# Xcode project (spec build-mobile-shell, stories 1/6) — NOT the old hand-
# assembled swiftc script. `xcodebuild` drives `mobile/ios/App/WezigShell.xcodeproj`,
# whose "Build Zig static lib" build phase cross-compiles the wezig Zig core into
# `libwezig_mobile.a` as a NORMAL build step and links it into the Swift app.
# Designed to run on a GitHub macos-14 runner (CI is the Mac) OR locally on a Mac
# with Xcode. NO code signing / no Apple Developer account — Simulator only.
#
# Steps: build the app for the iOS Simulator with `xcodebuild` (which runs the
# Zig-lib build phase, then compiles + links the Swift shell); boot an iOS 17
# Simulator; install; launch; assert the Zig-linked greeting reached the log.
#
# BUILD_ONLY=1 stops after the .app is built (used by the release workflow to
# package the Simulator app without booting/launching a simulator).
